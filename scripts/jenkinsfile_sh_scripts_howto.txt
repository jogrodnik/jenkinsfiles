To make the script more professional and suitable for running in Jenkins, weâ€™ll add the following improvements:

Logging and Output Control: Use logging with timestamps to capture outputs, and use functions to improve readability.
Environment Variables: Support environment variables for flexibility, making it suitable for Jenkins.
Error Handling and Exit Codes: Add error handling to exit gracefully on failures.
Jenkins-Compatible Output: Use specific markers in the output to make it readable in Jenkins logs.
Credential Management: Ensure the script can activate a GCP service account key provided via Jenkins to manage permissions.
